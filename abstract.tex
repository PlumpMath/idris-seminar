This talk will introduce students to functional programming
with value-dependent types, using the Idris programming language.
It will cover ...

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic information about the Idris programming language
\item Reasoning about program behaviour with types & constraints
\item Standard examples of value-dependent data types
\item Common typeclasses and their laws
\item Essential examples of proofs of program correctness in Idris
\end{itemize}

The goal is to enhance each student's ability to write clear, concise
and correct programs, regardless of whether they choose to adopt Idris
in their daily work or not.

Some prior exposure to functional programming, perhaps in Racket/Scheme,
would be an asset.
