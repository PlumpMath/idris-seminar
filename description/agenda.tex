We will begin this workshop by covering basic information about the Idris programming language \& introducing our audience to the idea of reasoning about program behaviour with types and constraints. Afterwards,
we will then provide key examples of value-dependent data types in Idris (i.e. Vectors, Graphs \& Polyhedra) as well common type classes and their laws (i.e. Semigroups, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives, Monads, Foldables \& Traversables).
Finally, we will provide proofs in Idris that certain value-dependent data types are valid instances of these type classes.
