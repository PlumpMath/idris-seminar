By the end of this workshop, we hope to movitate our audience to use and contribute to Idris. Though, we
will be content if our audience has gained an appreciation of how dependently typed functional programming
can assist them in ensuring the correctness of their software in an industrial setting - regardless of whether
or not they choose to adopt Idris in their daily work.
