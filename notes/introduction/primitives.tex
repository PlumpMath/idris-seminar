Although, we've explicitly included support for certain primitive types, namely fixed-width integers, floating point numbers \& foreign pointers on top of this core language \cite{brady2013idris};
we've added support for these primitive types in order to to achieve reasonable performance when performing numerical computations \& doing systems programming in Idris.
